Brian Erly is originally from Tucson, Arizona and received an MPH from the University of Arizona. His medical training includes an MD from Case Western and residency training in Preventive Medicine at UC Davis and the University of Colorado.

Dr. Erly lives with his wife Katharine, three daughters, and labradors. He enjoys being outdoors, watching Bravo with his wife, and cooking gluten free meals, which are not as good as meals with gluten. Outside of work he spends his time swimming laps with the DU Masters team, and will occasionally swim too far and hurt his shoulders. The same applies to pickup soccer, but with knee pain instead of shoulder pain.
